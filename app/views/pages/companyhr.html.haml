				Technical Recruiting 101 is designed for
				<strong>in-house HR/recruiting professionals</strong>
				who want to make an impact on the company's business by
				meeting its critical
				<strong>technical talent acquisition</strong> needs,
				yet feeling bogged down by the jargon
				and cryptic language in job descriptions and
				resumes, commonly used by technical people.
			%p
				This course will lay a solid foundation for understanding
				the inner working of 
				typical <strong>software engineering teams</strong>,
				tools of the trade,
				how technical people work individually
				and as a group.  You&rsquo;ll learn how to
				<strong>decode technical terms</strong>,
				<strong>ask revealing questions</strong> to
				hiring managers and candidates, find
				<strong>resources and best practices</strong>
				for technical recruiting. You can apply to this
				knowledge immediately and
				make your recruiting easier and more productive.
			%p
				Each week, we&rsquo;ll meet for a 3-hour session, which
				includes two parts: <strong>presentation</strong> and
				<strong>interactive workshop</strong>
				(using real job descriptions and resumes
				at your company).  We keep this
				class small so everyoneâ€™s questions and needs can be addressed.
