	  Technical Training 101 is designed for
	  <strong>in-house HR/recruiting professionals</strong>
	  who want to make an impact on the company's business by
	  meeting its critical
	  <strong>technical talent acquisition</strong> needs,
	  yet feeling bogged down by the jargon
	  and cryptic language in job descriptions and
	  resumes, commonly used by technical people.

	<p>
	  This course will lay a solid foundation for understanding
	  the inner working of 
	  typical <strong>software engineering teams</strong>,
	  tools of the trade,
	  how technical people work individually
	  and as a group.  You&rsquo;ll learn how to
	  <strong>decode technical terms</strong>,
	  <strong>ask revealing questions</strong> to
	  hiring managers and candidates, find
	  <strong>resources and best practices</strong>
	  for technical recruiting. You can apply to this
	  knowledge immediately and
	  make your recruiting easier and more productive.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Each week, we&rsquo;ll meet for a 3-hour session, which
	  includes two parts: <strong>presentation</strong> and
	  <strong>interactive workshop</strong>
	  (using real job descriptions and resumes
	  at your company).  We keep this
	  class small so everyoneâ€™s questions and needs can be addressed.
